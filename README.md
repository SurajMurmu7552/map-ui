## Map UI

- Made using React-leaflet,redux-toolkit and antd

- app has three options of countries[ IND, US, UK ] to select and load details with focus on the map.

- Didn't have the api to get details so used dummy data.

- App running at Netlify ==> [link](https://elated-mestorf-92a756.netlify.app/)
